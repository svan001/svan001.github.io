## Hi !

I'm Stéphane Gronowski, currently working as a freelance software engineer in France. Here you will find information about me and the service I can provide.

## Expertise

I've been working in software development since 2011, mainly around the Java ecosystem as a fullstack software developper. I've helped businesses ranging from international retailer to growing startup build and improve the software they needed to solve their problems and provide value to their customers.

I have experiences building and maintaining robust applications and designing architecture that can solve problem, scale and lower maintenance time.
